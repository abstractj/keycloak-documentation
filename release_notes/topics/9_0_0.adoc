= Highlights

== Drools Policy Removed

The Drools Policy was finally removed after the deprecation period. If you need more complex policies you can still use JavaScript-based policies.

== Pagination support for clients

Pagination support was added to clients in the Admin Console and REST API. Thanks to https://github.com/saibot94[saibot94].

== New Elytron Credential Store Vault Provider

A new built-in vault provider that reads secrets from a keystore-backed Elytron credential store has been added as a WildFly
extension. The creation and management of the credential store is handled by Elytron using either the `elytron` subsystem or the
`elytron-tool.sh` script.

== Other improvements

* Authorization Header token is only considered now when type is Bearer on Gatekeeper. Thanks to https://github.com/HansK-p[HansK-p]
